### Search

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

### Linear Search

Linear Search is a search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in the list to see if it is the one we are looking for. The time complexity of Linear Search is O(n).

### Binary Search

Binary search is one of the most efficient way to search a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing half the portion of the list that could 
contain the target item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.


a very simple explanation of this algorithm can be found here

Time complexity of this algorithm is O(logn) (read as O of logn), that means in an array of 12 elements in the worst case you will have to make 3 look ups. while incase of a linear search it would be 11 look ups.
