#### [Perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.
e.g 28 is a perfect number divisors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14 which sum upto 28 = (1+2+4,7+14)

## Armstrong number:

```
An Armstrong number is a number such that the sum  of its digits raised to the third power is equal to the number itself.
For example, 371 is an Armstrong number, since 3^3+7^3+1^3 = 371

### 1. Given input n print first n elements of the Series of the form 2,6,6,12,12,12,20,20,20,20,30,30,30,30,30....


#### [Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

```
In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal    to n. For example, The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.
e.g 5! = 120 i.e 5x4x3x2x1=120

#### Printing alternate prime numbers
```
prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41...
Alternate Prime: 2, 5, 11, 17, 23, 31, 41...
```

#### [Fibonnaci series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

```
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1.
```

#### [GCD of two numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)

```
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two nonzero integers a and b is the greatest positive integer d such that d is a divisor of both a and b; that is, there are integers e and f such that a = de and b = df, and d is the largest such integer. The GCD of a and b is generally denoted gcd(a, b).
```

#### [HCF/GCF of two numbers](https://www.smartick.com/blog/math/learning-resources/greatest-common-factor-gcf/)

```
HCF of two numbers is the highest common number, which is available in both the numbers. ... Sometimes, it is also called the greatest common factor (GCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD). For example, the HCF of 2 and 4 is 2, because 2 is the number which is common to both 2 and 4.

## [Between Two Sets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets/problem)

```
There will be two arrays of integers. Determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

- The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
- The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. Determine how many such numbers exist.

Example

input:
a=[2,4]
b=[16,32,96]

output: 3
```
