- Linked Lists




#### Linked Lists

    Linked lists are a data structure that are linear data structures.
    They are a type of data structure that are made up of nodes.
    Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
    The first node in the linked list is called the head node.
    The last node in the linked list is called the tail node.

    Linked lists help us to store data in a linear fashion. They store the data in a linear fashion and are very efficient for searching and traversing.

    The time complexity for searching and traversing a linked list is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
    While, The time complexity for inserting and deleting a node in a linked list is O(1) in compared to O(n) in an array. This is because, in an array, we have to shift the elements to the right or left when we insert or delete an element.
