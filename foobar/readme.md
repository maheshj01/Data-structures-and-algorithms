## Google Foobar

Foobar is a Google recruiting challenge. It is a series of 5 levels, each with 1-5 challenges. The challenges are timed and the time limit is usually 48 hours. The challenges are algorithmic in nature and can be solved in any language. The challenges are not easy and require a good understanding of algorithms and data structures. The challenges are fun and rewarding to solve.

Here are some of the challenges from Google Foobar

### Braille Translation (Problem 1, Level 1)
======================

Because Commander Lambda is an equal-opportunity despot, she has several visually-impaired minions. But she never bothered to follow intergalactic standards for workplace accommodations, so those minions have a hard time navigating her space station. You figure printing out Braille signs will help them, and - since you’ll be promoting efficiency at the same time - increase your chances of a promotion.

Braille is a writing system used to read by touch instead of by sight. Each character is composed of 6 dots in a 2x3 grid, where each dot can either be a bump or be flat (no bump). You plan to translate the signs around the space station to Braille so that the minions under Commander Lambda’s command can feel the bumps on the signs and “read” the text with their touch. The special printer which can print the bumps onto the signs expects the dots in the following order:

1 4
2 5
3 6
So given the plain text word “code”, you get the Braille dots:

11 10 11 10
00 01 01 01
00 10 00 00

where 1 represents a bump and 0 represents no bump. Put together, code becomes the output string 100100101010100110100010.

Write a function solution(plaintext) that takes a string parameter and returns a string of 1’s and 0’s representing the bumps and absence of bumps in the input string. Your function should be able to encode the 26 lowercase letters, handle capital letters by adding a Braille capitalization mark before that character, and use a blank character (000000) for spaces. All signs on the space station are less than fifty characters long and use only letters and spaces.

Test Cases
Input:

(string) plaintext = "code"
Output:

(string) "100100101010100110100010"
Input:

(string) plaintext = "Braille"
Output:

(string) "000001110000111010100000010100111000111000100010"
Input:

(string) plaintext = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output:

(string) "000001011110110010100010000000111110101001010100100100101000000000110000111010101010010111101110000000110100101010101101000000010110101001101100111100100010100110000000101010111001100010111010000000011110110010100010000000111000100000101011101111000000100110101010110110"


### Bunny Worker Locations (Problem 1, Level 2)
======================
Keeping track of Commander Lambda's many bunny workers is starting to get tricky. You've been tasked with writing a program to match bunny worker IDs to cell locations.

The LAMBCHOP doomsday device takes up much of the interior of Commander Lambda's space station, and as a result the work areas have an unusual layout. They are stacked in a triangular shape, and the bunny workers are given numerical IDs starting from the corner, as follows:

| 7
| 4 8
| 2 5 9
| 1 3 6 10

Each cell can be represented as points (x, y), with x being the distance from the vertical wall, and y being the height from the ground.

For example, the bunny worker at (1, 1) has ID 1, the bunny worker at (3, 2) has ID 9, and the bunny worker at (2,3) has ID 8. This pattern of numbering continues indefinitely (Commander Lambda has been adding a LOT of workers).

Write a function solution(x, y) which returns the worker ID of the bunny at location (x, y). Each value of x and y will be at least 1 and no greater than 100,000. Since the worker ID can be very large, return your solution as a string representation of the number.

### Power Hungry (Problem 2, Level 2)
============
Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen have been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you'd rather not take down all of the panels at once if you can help it, since they do help power the space station and all!

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function solution(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30. So solution([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the solution as a string representation of the number.

### Bomb Baby (Problem 1, Level 3)
===========
You're so close to destroying the LAMBCHOP doomsday device you can taste it! But in order to do so, you need to deploy special self-replicating bombs designed for you by the brightest scientists on Bunny Planet. There are two types: Mach bombs (M) and Facula bombs (F). The bombs, once released into the LAMBCHOP's inner workings, will automatically deploy to all the strategic points you've identified and destroy them at the same time.

But there's a few catches. First, the bombs self-replicate via one of two distinct processes:
Every Mach bomb retrieves a sync unit from a Facula bomb; for every Mach bomb, a Facula bomb is created;
Every Facula bomb spontaneously creates a Mach bomb.

For example, if you had 3 Mach bombs and 2 Facula bombs, they could either produce 3 Mach bombs and 5 Facula bombs, or 5 Mach bombs and 2 Facula bombs. The replication process can be changed each cycle.

Second, you need to ensure that you have exactly the right number of Mach and Facula bombs to destroy the LAMBCHOP device. Too few, and the device might survive. Too many, and you might overload the mass capacitors and create a singularity at the heart of the space station - not good!

And finally, you were only able to smuggle one of each type of bomb - one Mach, one Facula - aboard the ship when you arrived, so that's all you have to start with. (Thus it may be impossible to deploy the bombs to destroy the LAMBCHOP, but that's not going to stop you from trying!)

You need to know how many replication cycles (generations) it will take to generate the correct amount of bombs to destroy the LAMBCHOP. Write a function solution(M, F) where M and F are the number of Mach and Facula bombs needed. Return the fewest number of generations (as a string) that need to pass before you'll have the exact number of bombs necessary to destroy the LAMBCHOP, or the string "impossible" if this can't be done! M and F will be string representations of positive integers no larger than 10^50. For example, if M = "2" and F = "1", one generation would need to pass, so the solution would be "1". However, if M = "2" and F = "4", it would not be possible.

### Queue To Do (Problem 2, Level 3)
===========
You're almost ready to make your move to destroy the LAMBCHOP doomsday device, but the security checkpoints that guard the underlying systems of the LAMBCHOP are going to be a problem. You were able to take one down without tripping any alarms, which is great! Except that as Commander Lambda's assistant, you've learned that the checkpoints are about to come under automated review, which means that your sabotage will be discovered and your cover blown -- unless you can trick the automated review system.

To trick the system, you'll need to write a program to return the same security checksum that the bunny trainers would have after they would have checked all the workers through. Fortunately, Commander Lambda's desire for efficiency won't allow for hours-long lines, so the trainers at the checkpoint have found ways to quicken the pass-through rate. Instead of checking each and every worker coming through, the bunny trainers instead go over everyone in line while noting their worker IDs, then allow the line to fill back up. Once they've done that they go over the line again, this time leaving off the last worker. They continue doing this, leaving off one more worker from the line each time but recording the worker IDs of those they do check, until they skip the entire line, at which point they XOR the IDs of all the workers they noted into a checksum and then take off for lunch. Fortunately, the workers' orderly nature causes them to always line up in numerical order without any gaps.

For example, if the first worker in line has ID 0 and the security checkpoint line holds three workers, the process would look like this:
0 1 2 /
3 4 / 5
6 / 7 8
where the trainers' XOR (^) checksum is 0^1^2^3^4^6 == 2.

Likewise, if the first worker has ID 17 and the checkpoint holds four workers, the process would look like:
17 18 19 20 /
21 22 23 / 24
25 26 / 27 28
29 / 30 31 32
which produces the checksum 17^18^19^20^21^22^23^25^26^29 == 14.

All worker IDs (including the first worker) are between 0 and 2000000000 inclusive, and the checkpoint line will always be at least 1 worker long.

With this information, write a function solution(start, length) that will cover for the missing security checkpoint by outputting the same checksum the trainers would normally submit before lunch. You have just enough time to find out the ID of the first worker to be checked (start) and the length of the line (length) before the automatic review occurs, so your program must generate the proper checksum with just those two values.

### Fuel Injection Perfection (Problem 3, Level 3) 
=========================
Commander Lambda has asked for your help to refine the automatic quantum antimatter fuel injection system for the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. It's a great chance for you to get a closer look at the LAMBCHOP -- and maybe sneak in a bit of sabotage while you're at it -- so you took the job gladly.

Quantum antimatter fuel comes in small pellets, which is convenient since the many moving parts of the LAMBCHOP each need to be fed fuel one pellet at a time. However, minions dump pellets in bulk into the fuel intake. You need to figure out the most efficient way to sort and shift the pellets down to a single pellet at a time.

The fuel control mechanisms have three operations:

1) Add one fuel pellet
2) Remove one fuel pellet
3) Divide the entire group of fuel pellets by 2 (due to the destructive energy released when a quantum antimatter pellet is cut in half, the safety controls will only allow this to happen if there is an even number of pellets)

Write a function called solution(n) which takes a positive integer as a string and returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform the number of pellets to 1. The fuel intake control panel can only display a number up to 309 digits long, so there won't ever be more pellets than you can express in that many digits.

For example:
solution(4) returns 2: 4 -> 2 -> 1
solution(15) returns 5: 15 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

Running with Bunnies
====================
You and the bunny workers need to get out of this collapsing death trap of a space station -- and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have been weakened by their long work shifts and can't run very fast. Their friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close.

The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave -- you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits.

In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added.

Write a function of the form solution(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest worker IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by worker ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999.

For instance, in the case of
[
[0, 2, 2, 2, -1], # 0 = Start
[9, 0, 2, 2, -1], # 1 = Bunny 0
[9, 3, 0, 2, -1], # 2 = Bunny 1
[9, 3, 2, 0, -1], # 3 = Bunny 2
[9, 3, 2, 2, 0], # 4 = Bulkhead
]
and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:

Start End Delta Time Status
- 0 - 1 Bulkhead initially open
0 4 -1 2
4 2 2 0
2 4 -1 1
4 3 2 -1 Bulkhead closes
3 4 -1 0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit

With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best combination for this space station hallway, so the solution is [1, 2].
