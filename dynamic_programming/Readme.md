### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time.

Steps to solve DP problems:

1. Define the objective function f(n): (What is input and output?)
2. Identify the base cases
3. Write down a recurrence relation for the optimized objective function by idenifying the patterns in the base cases
4. Order of Computation: Top Down or Bottom Up
5. Location of the answer: Return f(n)

There are two types of Dynamic Programming problems

1. Combinatorial Problems: These problems are solved by generating all possible combinations of the solution and then selecting the best one. For example, the knapsack problem.
2. Optimization Problems: These problems are solved by finding the best solution from all possible solutions. For example, the Fibonacci sequence.
