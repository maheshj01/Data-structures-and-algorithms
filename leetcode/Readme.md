class Node {
public int val;
public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.
```
Example 1:

Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.
```
Example 1:

Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat

### [Problem 729. My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/)

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
```
Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]

Explanation
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20
```

### [Problem 731. My Calendar II](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/)

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:

MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
```
Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendarTwo", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, true, true]

Explanation
MyCalendarTwo myCalendarTwo = new MyCalendarTwo();
myCalendarTwo.book(10, 20); // return True, The event can be booked.
myCalendarTwo.book(50, 60); // return True, The event can be booked.
myCalendarTwo.book(10, 40); // return True, The event can be double booked.
myCalendarTwo.book(5, 15);  // return False, The event cannot be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
myCalendarTwo.book(5, 10); // return True, The event can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
myCalendarTwo.book(25, 55); // return True, The event can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event, the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time([50, 55) will be double booked with the second event
```

### [Problem 733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill:

Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/01/flood1-grid.jpg)

```
Example 1:

Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.

Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.

Example 2:
Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Explanation:
The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.

### [Problem 826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/)

We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job.

Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i].

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.

What is the most profit we can make?
```

Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]

Output: 100

Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.

### [Problem 860. Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.
```
Example 1:

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation:
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
Example 2:

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]

Output: false
Explanation:
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false

### [Problem 874. Walking Robot Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-04)

A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of commands:

-2: Turn left 90 degrees.
-1: Turn right 90 degrees.
1 <= k <= 9: Move forward k units, one unit at a time.
Some of the grid squares are obstacles. The ith obstacle is at grid point obstacles[i] = (xi, yi). If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.

Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared (i.e. if the distance is 5, return 25).

Note:

North means +Y direction.
East means +X direction.
South means -Y direction.
West means -X direction.
There can be obstacle in [0,0].
```
Example 1:

Input: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
Output: 25
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 3 units to (3, 4).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (3, 4), which squared is 32 + 42 = 25 units away.

Example 2:

Input: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
Output: 65
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 1 unit and get blocked by the obstacle at (2, 4), robot is at (1, 4).
4. Turn left.
5. Move north 4 units to (1, 8).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (1, 8), which squared is 12 + 82 = 65 units away.

Example 3:

Input: commands = [6,-1,-1,6], obstacles = []
Output: 36
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 6 units to (0, 6).
2. Turn right.
3. Turn right.
4. Move south 6 units to (0, 0).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (0, 6), which squared is 62 = 36 units away

### [Problem 877. Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/)

Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The total number of stones across all the piles is odd, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the beginning or from the end of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins the game, or false if Bob wins.
```
Example 1:

Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move
for Alice, so we return true.

Example 2:

Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
Output: tru

### [Problem 901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)

Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.

### [Problem 1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/)

There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.
```
Example 1:

Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it

### [Problem 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/description/)

You are given an m x n integer matrix points (0-indexed). Starting with 0 points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in each row. Picking the cell at coordinates (r, c) will add points[r][c] to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows r and r + 1 (where 0 <= r < m - 1), picking cells at coordinates (r, c1) and (r + 1, c2) will subtract abs(c1 - c2) from your score.

Return the maximum number of points you can achieve.

abs(x) is defined as:

x for x >= 0.
-x for x < 0.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/12/screenshot-2021-07-12-at-13-40-26-diagram-drawio-diagrams-net.png)
```
Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation:
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.
Your final score is 11 - 2 = 9.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 11
Explanation:
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1 from your score.

### [Problem 2028. Find Missing Observations](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-observations/description/)

You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.
```
Example 1:

Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: rolls = [1,5,6], mean = 3, n = 4
Output: [2,3,2,2]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (1 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2) / 7 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: rolls = [1,2,3,4], mean = 6, n = 4
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible for the mean to be 6 no matter what the 4 missing rolls are

### [Problem 2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-distinct-string-in-an-array/description)

A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".

Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.
```
Example 1:

Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The only distinct strings in arr are "d" and "a".
"d" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
"a" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2, "a" is returned.
Example 2:

Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string "aaa" is returned.
Example 3:

Input: arr = ["a","b","a"], k = 3
Output: ""
Explanation:
The only distinct string is "b". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string ""

### [Problem 2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/description/)

A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.

A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
```
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:

- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
  The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
  The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3
```

### [Problem 2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/description/)

You are given an integer n indicating there are n specialty retail stores. There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.

You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:

A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.
Return the minimum possible x.
```

Example 1:

Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
- The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
Output: 5
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 1, quantities = [100000]
Output: 100000
Explanation: The only optimal way is:
- The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.


Constraints:

m == quantities.length
1 <= m <= n <= 105
1 <= quantities[i] <= 10

### [Problem 2073. Time Needed to Buy Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-needed-to-buy-tickets-in-queue/description/)

There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].

Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.

Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.
```
Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:

- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [1, 2, 1].
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [0, 1, 0].
  The person at position 2 has successfully bought 2 tickets and it took 3 + 3 = 6 seconds.

Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: 8
Explanation:

- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes [4, 0, 0, 0].
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets.
  The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets and it took 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds
```

### [Problem 2109. Adding Spaces to a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/adding-spaces-to-a-string/)

You are given a 0-indexed string s and a 0-indexed integer array spaces that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted before the character at the given index.

For example, given s = "EnjoyYourCoffee" and spaces = [5, 9], we place spaces before 'Y' and 'C', which are at indices 5 and 9 respectively. Thus, we obtain "Enjoy Your Coffee".
Return the modified string after the spaces have been added.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn", spaces = [8,13,15]
Output: "Leetcode Helps Me Learn"
Explanation: 
The indices 8, 13, and 15 correspond to the underlined characters in "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn".
We then place spaces before those characters.
Example 2:

Input: s = "icodeinpython", spaces = [1,5,7,9]
Output: "i code in py thon"
Explanation:
The indices 1, 5, 7, and 9 correspond to the underlined characters in "icodeinpython".
We then place spaces before those characters.
Example 3:

Input: s = "spacing", spaces = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: " s p a c i n g"
Explanation:
We are also able to place spaces before the first character of the string.

### [Problem 2181. (Medium): 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-nodes-in-between-zeros/description/)

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.
```
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains

- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.

### [Problem 2182. Construct String With Repeat Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-with-repeat-limit/description/)

You are given a string s and an integer repeatLimit. Construct a new string repeatLimitedString using the characters of s such that no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row. You do not have to use all characters from s.

Return the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. If the first min(a.length, b.length) characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

```

Example 1:

Input: s = "cczazcc", repeatLimit = 3
Output: "zzcccac"
Explanation: We use all of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "zzcccac".
The letter 'a' appears at most 1 time in a row.
The letter 'c' appears at most 3 times in a row.
The letter 'z' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "zzcccac".
Note that the string "zzcccca" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'c' appears more than 3 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aababab", repeatLimit = 2
Output: "bbabaa"
Explanation: We use only some of the characters from s to construct the repeatLimitedString "bbabaa". 
The letter 'a' appears at most 2 times in a row.
The letter 'b' appears at most 2 times in a row.
Hence, no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row and the string is a valid repeatLimitedString.
The string is the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible so we return "bbabaa".
Note that the string "bbabaaa" is lexicographically larger but the letter 'a' appears more than 2 times in a row, so it is not a valid repeatLimitedString.
 

Constraints:

1 <= repeatLimit <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```

### [Problem: 2220. (Easy): Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number/description/)

A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of x and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

For example, for x = 7, the binary representation is 111 and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get 110, flip the second bit from the right to get 101, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get 10111, etc.
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.
```

Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:

- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
  It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string

```
sExample 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strings in words which are a prefix of s = "abc" are:
"a", "ab", and "abc".
Thus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","a"], s = "aa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Both of the strings are a prefix of s. 
Note that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
```

Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

### [Problem 2490. Circular Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-sentence)

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is circular if:

The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
For example, "leetcode exercises sound delightful", "eetcode", "leetcode eats soul" are all circular sentences. However, "Leetcode is cool", "happy Leetcode", "Leetcode" and "I like Leetcode" are not circular sentences.

Given a string sentence, return true if it is circular. Otherwise, return false.

### [Problem 3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/description)

You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c" .

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.

Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, \*, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.
```

Input: word = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
```

### [Problem 3042. (Easy) Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-prefix-and-suffix-pairs-i)

You are given a 0-indexed string array words.

Let's define a boolean function isPrefixAndSuffix that takes two strings, str1 and str2:

isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) returns true if str1 is both a 
prefix
 and a 
suffix
 of str2, and false otherwise.
For example, isPrefixAndSuffix("aba", "ababa") is true because "aba" is a prefix of "ababa" and also a suffix, but isPrefixAndSuffix("abc", "abcd") is false.

Return an integer denoting the number of index pairs (i, j) such that i < j, and isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]) is true.

```
Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","aba","ababa","aa"]
Output: 4
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "aba") is true.
i = 0 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "ababa") is true.
i = 0 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "aa") is true.
i = 1 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix("aba", "ababa") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 4.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["pa","papa","ma","mama"]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix("pa", "papa") is true.
i = 2 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix("ma", "mama") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 2.  
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abab","ab"]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, the only valid index pair is i = 0 and j = 1, and isPrefixAndSuffix("abab", "ab") is false.
Therefore, the answer is 0.

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.

queries[i] = [ui, vi] represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city ui to city vi. After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1.

Return an array answer where for each i in the range [0, queries.length - 1], answer[i] is the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the first i + 1 queries.
