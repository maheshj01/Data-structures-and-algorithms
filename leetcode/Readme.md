## Leetcode

#### [Sorting the Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/)

```
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
