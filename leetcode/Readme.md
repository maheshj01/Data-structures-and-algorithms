## Leetcode

### [Problem 1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

#### [Problem 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```
input : "abcabcbb"
output : 3
Explanation : The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

```
input : "bbbbb"
output : 1
Explanation : The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```


### [Problem 5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Explanation: "aba" is a palindrome, "bab" is a substring.
```

### [Problem 6. ZigZag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)

```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Explanation:
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

### [Problem 7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

### [Problem 8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)

```
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
            ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
              ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.
```

### [Problem 49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Explanation: The groupings are as follows:
"ate", "eat", and "tea" are all anagrams of each other, so they all belong to the same group.
"nat" and "tan" are anagrams of each other, so they all belong to the same group.
"bat" is not an anagram of any other word, so it its own group.
```


### [Problem 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The 2nd largest element is 5.
```


### [Problem 217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

### [Problem 238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Explanation: The array of the products of all other elements is [24,12,8,6]. The product of all the elements of nums is 24. So, for each index i in nums, we have nums[i] = 24 / nums[i].
```


### [Problem 242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t contain all the same letters, in the same frequency, so they are anagrams.
```

### [Problem 347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order. In this case, the answer is [1,2] because both 1 and 2 appear twice, and 1 comes before 2.
```

#### [Problem 1859. Sorting the Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/)

```
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
```
