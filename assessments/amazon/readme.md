Question
In the context of an Amazon gaming product involving a snake and apples on a number line, the scenario unfolds with a set of unique coordinates representing the positions of the apples. The array named position of size n holds these unique integers, each denoting the coordinate of the th apple.

The snake, starting at the origin (0 coordinate), decides to consume some of the apples. The snake can move left and right along the line at a constant speed of 1 unit/sec, allowing it to transition from a coordinate x to x + 1 or x-1 in 1 second. Additionally, the snake can instantly eat an apple when it occupies the same coordinate as the apple.

Given an integer kand the array position, Determine the minimum time required for the snake to consume at least kapples.

Example

k=3
n=3

position:[-20, 5, 10]
output: 40
